            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">I created this interactive map visualization as a sample project to demonstrate qualities that make me an excellent fit for the Project Manager position at Global Energy Monitor (GEM):</p>
            <ul class="list-none space-y-4 text-gray-700">
                <li>
                    <strong class="font-semibold text-emerald-800 block mb-1">1. Strategic Project Focus:</strong> Understanding that this role involves building a global chemical plant tracker similar to GEM's existing industry trackers, I focused on creating a map visualization backed by a database â€“ GEM's core product format. The choice of Shandong province was strategic: it hosts the largest chemical sector within China, which in turn has the world's largest chemical industry. This demonstrates an ability to prioritize impactful work aligned with organizational goals.

                    <strong class="font-semibold text-emerald-800 block mb-1">2. Relevant Regional Expertise:</strong> Focusing on facilities in China showcases my direct experience working in the region and my professional proficiency in the Chinese language, both valuable assets for global data collection and analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="font-semibold text-emerald-800 block mb-1">3. Technical Acumen & Scalability:</strong> Building this visualization involved using Python for data processing, leveraging APIs (Google Geocoding, Google Translate), and hosting the result online. This demonstrates technical skills relevant to managing data-intensive projects and an understanding of how technology can automate and scale work beyond manual capabilities.

            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">This map displays the locations of approximately 200 chemical companies within Shandong Province, China. The size of the points may relate to registered capital, used here as a proxy for operational scale.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-emerald-900">Methodology</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">This visualization was created as a sample project within a limited timeframe (approx. 4 hours) to demonstrate relevant skills. The process aimed for scalability for potential future work on mapping chemical facilities in China.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Data Sourcing & Challenges:</strong> Initial research sought lists of chemical plants in Shandong, particularly focusing on energy consumption data (>10k tce). Accessing official Shandong government websites proved difficult, potentially due to IP address restrictions. Commercial datasets were identified but not purchased due to budget constraints for this sample project. A publicly available list of ~1500 Shandong chemical companies (including addresses and registered capital) was used as the primary data source, with registered capital serving as an imperfect proxy for operational size.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Scoping:</strong> To manage processing time within the constraints, the list was narrowed down to a sample of 200 companies for location identification and name translation using free tools.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Processing & Enhancement:</strong> A GitHub Codespace environment was used with Python scripts for data scraping (where applicable), processing, cleaning, and enhancement. Google Geocoding API was utilized to obtain latitude/longitude coordinates from Chinese addresses. Google Translate API was used to translate company names into English. The processed data was exported to a CSV file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Map Development:</strong> The Flourish platform was chosen for map creation due to its efficient handling of CSV data and map customization options. A map of China was adapted to focus specifically on Shandong Province. The processed CSV data was imported to plot the company locations.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-emerald-900">Potential Refinements & Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Given adequate time, budget, and resources (as would be available in an employment context), the following improvements could significantly enhance the dataset and visualization:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700">
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Main Products Data:</strong> Incorporating main products for each facility is crucial for understanding process types and potential energy intensity. This could potentially be automated using AI APIs (e.g., Perplexity API) to search and extract product information, followed by verification against web sources.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improve Geocoding Accuracy:</strong> Utilize Baidu Maps Geocoding API or other China-specific mapping services, as they generally offer higher accuracy for Chinese addresses compared to Google Maps API.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Access Government Data:</strong> Employ a Chinese proxy server or VPN to potentially overcome IP restrictions and access official government databases or environmental disclosure platforms for more comprehensive and verified facility lists and energy consumption data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Acquire Commercial Datasets:</strong> Research and potentially purchase commercially available datasets focused on the Chinese chemical industry (identified options were under $100), which may offer more detailed and curated information than publicly available sources.
