                    <strong class="font-semibold text-emerald-800 block mb-1">1. Strategic Project Focus:</strong> Understanding that this role involves building a global chemical plant tracker similar to GEM's existing industry trackers, I focused on creating a map visualization backed by a database â€“ GEM's core product format. The choice of Shandong province was strategic: it hosts the largest chemical sector within China, which in turn has the world's largest chemical industry. This demonstrates an ability to prioritize impactful work aligned with organizational goals.

            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">This visualization was created as a sample project to demonstrate relevant skills. The process aimed for scalability for potential future work on mapping chemical facilities in China.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Data Sourcing & Challenges:</strong> Initial research sought lists of chemical plants in Shandong, particularly focusing on energy consumption data (>10k tce). Accessing official Shandong government websites proved difficult, potentially due to IP address restrictions. Commercial datasets were identified but not purchased due to budget constraints for this sample project. A publicly available list of ~1500 Shandong chemical companies (including addresses and registered capital) was used as the primary data source, with registered capital serving as an imperfect proxy for operational size.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Scoping:</strong> To manage processing time within the constraints, the list was narrowed down to a sample of 200 companies for location identification and name translation using free tools.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Processing & Enhancement:</strong> A GitHub Codespace environment was used with Python scripts for data scraping (where applicable), processing, cleaning, and enhancement. Google Geocoding API was utilized to obtain latitude/longitude coordinates from Chinese addresses. Google Translate API was used to translate company names into English. The processed data was exported to a CSV file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Map Development:</strong> The Flourish platform was chosen for map creation due to its efficient handling of CSV data and map customization options. A map of China was adapted to focus specifically on Shandong Province. The processed CSV data was imported to plot the company information.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-emerald-900">Potential Refinements & Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">Given adequate time, budget, and resources (as would be available in an employment context), the following improvements could significantly enhance the dataset and visualization:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700">
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Main Products Data:</strong> Incorporating main products for each facility is crucial for understanding process types and potential energy intensity. This can be obtained from commercial datasets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improve Geocoding Accuracy:</strong> Utilize Baidu Maps Geocoding API or other China-specific mapping services, as they generally offer higher accuracy for Chinese addresses compared to Google Maps API.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Access Government Data:</strong> Employ a Chinese proxy server or VPN to potentially overcome IP restrictions and access official government databases or environmental disclosure platforms for more comprehensive and verified facility lists.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Acquire Commercial Datasets:</strong> Research and potentially purchase commercially available datasets focused on the Chinese chemical industry (identified options were under $100), which may offer more detailed and curated information than publicly available sources.
