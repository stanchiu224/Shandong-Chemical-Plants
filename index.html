            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">I created this webpage as a sample project to showcase my qualifications and express my strong interest for the Project Manager, Chemicals position at Global Energy Monitor:</p>
            <ul class="list-none space-y-4 text-gray-700">
                <li>
                    <strong class="font-semibold text-emerald-800 block mb-1">1. Strategic Project Focus:</strong> Understanding that this role involves building a global chemical plant tracker similar to GEM's existing industry trackers, I focused on creating a map backed by a database, GEM's core product format. The choice of Shandong province was strategic: it hosts the largest chemical sector within China, which in turn has the world's largest chemical industry. This demonstrates my ability to identify high priority work aligned with organizational goals.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-emerald-900">Methodology</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">This visualization was created as a sample project to highlight relevant skills. The process aimed for scalability for potential future work on mapping chemical facilities in China.</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700">
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Sourcing & Challenges:</strong> I began by researching lists of chemical plants in Shandong, aiming to find facilities that were classified as "key energy consumption units". However, I was unable to access most of the relevant Shandong government websites, potentially due to foreign IP address restrictions. I found potential commercial datasets, but did not purchase them due to budget constraints for this sample project. A publicly available list of ~1500 Shandong chemical companies (including addresses and registered capital) was used as the primary data source, with registered capital serving as a proxy for operational size.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Scoping:</strong> To manage processing time within technical constraints, I narrowed the list to the largest 200 companies by registered capital for geocoding and name translation using free tools.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Processing & Enhancement:</strong> I made Python scripts to scrape data from the primary source website, and then processed, cleaned, and enriched the data. Google Geocoding API was used to obtain latitude/longitude coordinates from Chinese addresses. The Google Translate API was used to translate company names into English. The processed data was exported to a CSV file, which served as the data source for the Flourish map.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Map Development:</strong> I chose to use Flourish to create the map due to its map customization options and ease of use. I adapted a map of China to focus specifically on Shandong Province. Lastly, I uploaded the CSV data to Flourish to plot company.

                <li>
                    <strong>Documentation (This Page):</strong> This webpage serves as documentation, outlining the process, tools, challenges, and potential refinements to ensure the methodology is understandable and potentially scalable for future work by colleagues.

        <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-emerald-900">Potential Refinements & Next Steps</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">With adequate time, budget, and resources, the following improvements could significantly enhance the dataset and visualization:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-700">
                <li>
                    <strong>Add Main Products Data:</strong> Incorporating main products for each facility is crucial for understanding process types and potential energy intensity of each facility. This can be obtained from commercial datasets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improve Geocoding Accuracy:</strong> Use Baidu Maps Geocoding API or other China-specific mapping services, as they generally offer higher accuracy for Chinese addresses compared to Google Maps API.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Access Government Data:</strong> Use a Chinese proxy server or VPN to avoid IP restrictions and access official government databases for more comprehensive and verified facility lists.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Acquire Commercial Datasets:</strong> Research and potentially purchase commercial datasets focused on the Chinese chemical industry (identified options were under $100), which offer more detailed information than publicly available sources.
